<h1>About Us</h1>

<div class="page-words">

  <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>Jacqui, Alanah, and Christina are all students at Google's Computer Science Summer Institute, 2016. We made this website for our final project to demonstrate our skills in HTML, CSS, javascript, jquery, and python. Next year, Jacqui will be attending Carnegie Mellon Univeristy, Alanah will be attending Floria Tech, and Christina will be attending Georgia Tech.</p>
  <!--This is where we put our names and maybe some things about us and a picture
  us-->
  <h3>What was our inspiration behind the site?</h3>
    <p>While it can be nice to have choices, sometimes it's just stressful. From big choices (like where to attend college) to small choices (like where to go for dinner) and everywhere in between, it's hard to stay objective and organized when making a decision. We wanted to create a website that would solve this problem. (insert website name here) allows users to lay out all of their options next to all of the factors they care about, and see what choice is (mathematically) right for them. We're making people's lives easier, one question at a time!</p>
