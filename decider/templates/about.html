  <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>Hi! We are the creators of Decider 5000.</p>
  <!--This is where we put our names and maybe some things about us and a picture
  us-->
  <h3>What was our inspiration behind the site?</h3>
    <p>We wanted to make this website because as people that are given a variety of choices, we can hardly decide on what to do.  So, we thought is there a way to make someone's decision easier.  We kept thinking of different ways that could help someone's decision faster and more effiecent based on qualities they like. Then, BOOOOOM, Decider 5000 was created.  Giving people a way to make an easy decision based on things that are important to them is our motto. If we may say we are doing a good job upholding it.</p>
